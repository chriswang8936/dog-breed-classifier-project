# Dog-breed-classifier-Udacity project


## Project Overview
This project uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to learn how to build a pipeline to process real-world, user-supplied images. Given an image of a dog, the  algorithm will identify an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed. If supplied an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed.
